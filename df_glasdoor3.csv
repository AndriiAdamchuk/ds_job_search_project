Background

HM Courts and Tribunals Service is currently undertaking a first-of-its-kind Change Programme aimed at delivering pioneering modernisation of judicial services, exploiting digital technologies to deliver services that better serve the public. With over £1 Billion of funding this is the most ambitious programme of its kind anywhere in the world, working to ambitious timescales this is an exciting and rewarding portfolio to be part of.

Reform provides the opportunity to place citizen needs and expectations at the very heart of HMCTS. People will be able to participate with confidence, be treated with respect and understand what is happening at all stages of their case. Transformation will reduce cost and increase confidence of the judiciary, delivery partners and stakeholders in the justice system whilst delivering benefits both to HMCTS and to the taxpayers. Importantly, service transformation is key to ensuring that HMCTS is on a sustainable financial footing for the future, and will enhance the UK Justice system as a global leader.

Data Analyst – Insight and User Research

The Insight and User Research function ensures that our understanding of user characteristics, behaviours and needs, is analysed and shared in inspiring ways to inform decision making throughout HMCTS. This an exciting opportunity to be part of a multidisciplinary team, setting the direction for the use of analysis of user/citizen data to create insight across digital services, customer service, and operational delivery teams.

You will support the development and deployment of a multi-disciplinary insight approach, including utilising data led testing of digital services, analytics and data science to create a comprehensive and effective view of our service users. We are looking for experienced analysts who can work flexibly and take personal responsibility for the work they lead on. This work will be challenging and offers a wide range of opportunities to develop your skills and career and make a real difference.

Key Responsibilities

You will work on a variety of projects that require analytical thinking and hands-on coding/programming skills to generate insights on users of our services. Examples of projects in the team include:
• User segmentation: to improve our understanding of the different parties involved in 4 million cases per year across the civil, family, crime and tribunal jurisdictions, we combine HMCTS data with external reference data, from a range of sources, e.g. to complete geodemographic analysis using postcode data. This involves data manipulation, modelling and visualisation.
• Impact of Covid-19 on user needs and behaviours: to identify new issues affecting users or changes in behaviour, we have assessed a variety of sources including data on complaints, gov.uk browsing (Google Analytics), channel usage (paper/digital) and legal representation.

The role presents a rare opportunity to analyse the characteristics and behaviour of a wide variety of people, at scale, to inform the development of new services and continually improve the user experience in the operational business. The parties involved in cases, or potential cases, range from the individual money claimant seeking to recover funds from a company, to vulnerable social security appellants, or the victims of crime.

You will support the development of analysis across the organisation, building relationships and collaborating with other analytical teams across the department, the digital performance community, other government departments and external organisations to fill data and knowledge gaps and build on best practice.
