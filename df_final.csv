About us

GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you're speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behavior and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies, consistently renewing over 98% of our client base and doubling in size and revenue year-on-year. Our survey now represents more than 2 billion connected consumers, creating over 40,000 data points for clients including Twitter, Google, Spotify, WPP and Omnicom Group.

We're not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we're on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we're on the lookout for talented people to join us.

About diversity and inclusion

Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business. We're so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it's really important to us that it stays that way. That means whatever your race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.",3.0,"GWI

Data Analyst,£24K - £45K (Glassdoor est.),"We are looking for an individual who would be interested in a 3-month (possibly longer but this is TBC) contract. You will ideally be maths / data savvy because the role centres on data capture and transformation prior to input into our quantification models.

This position will likely suit a graduate or someone on a year off before university, however all applicants are encouraged to apply.

Ideally the role is to be in the London offices of this financial planning business, where they can provide double screens, fast internet, desk space etc and one or more of the team can be in the office one or more days each week to support. However, at the moment this looks unlikely with the current guidelines in place so if the only option is to work from home, then the person would need to have a space / desk with enough room for a double screen set-up (which they will supply).

The role will entail:
The source of information to be analysed in bank statements supplied by corporate clients. These are electronic (rather than on paper), mostly convertible into Excel although many are in PDF form.
This process involves transforming or re-inputting certain data fields from the statements into an Excel spreadsheet that we have designed. The design is linked to algorithms (models) which are programmed in R. No knowledge of R is required. It can take up to a day to process each company. There are up to 100 companies involved.
The key requirement is for accuracy. There will be spot checks by a supervising data analyst, and instructions on how to avoid typical mistakes (we’ve all done this and made them). You will be involved in daily team meetings where we all share what’s been completed and what’s next on our to-do list. This shares achievements and allows you to re-prioritise those to-do lists (new things come along that are more ‘urgent’ than ‘important’) when needed.
There is inevitably a high degree of repetition although this does have advantages – speed and efficiency go up, as does satisfaction (data transformation, as this is known, is a life skill for anyone who wants to work with numbers, in whatever field) and the sense of involvement within a team that knows what this takes and is grateful for your hard work and need it to be right so that the output can be fed into our algorithms (models).

Tableau, SQL, Data Analyst
Data Analyst
My client, an industry leading Professional Services company, is looking for a Data Analyst with strong Tableau and SQL skills to join their growing team.
You will be responsible for supporting the Insight Manager and Data Engineers with delivery of actionable insight on the back of Data Analysis you conduct. You would be involved in the optimisation, development & implementation of databases, data analytics, but will not get involved in the ETL / Data Engineering side - that is for another team. Your role will be to make sense of that data and tell a story to a Data Led organisation to help them improve how they operate across multiple areas of the organisation.
This is a role that requires great communication skills to engage with the business and stakeholders, in addition to strong Technical skills.
Because of the various databases, you would need to have strong SQL skills to interrogate the database
This will be put to the test during the interview process.
Whilst they also use Alteryx, the greater flexibility or SQL will be utilised more in future, so Alteryx is only a nice to have.
The first 6 months will be spent sorting out their current Tableau dashboards in operation (there are many that overlap, and are difficult to maintain, so must be streamlined to increase impact).
The key thing with this role is that you need Dashboarding skills, but also the ability to tell a story using data, and demonstrate actioned insight you have offered previous places of work.
It is critical that you have demonstrable examples of your Tableau dashboards to share in interview - either a portfolio or screenshots, as the design and presentation of data is very important in this position.
Whilst you would obviously be working from home in the short term, longer term they would like you to still interact personally with the stakeholders in the business, and so would need to be in around 3 days a week in the office - based in Central London, so remote workers are not encouraged to apply.
If you are keen to work in a stable and secure organisation that has some great data to work with then please get in touch ASAP with your CV and portfolio (for your dashboards).

Hello, we're Utility Warehouse

We help people get on with their lives and spend their time how they want to. And we’re bringing together a nation of self-starters to build a different type of utility company. One where partners can run their own business and reach the goals that matter to them.
For customers, we offer permanent peace of mind. One bill, great value and no need to ever switch again. And for our people, we provide clear opportunities to help them achieve both their professional and their personal ambitions.


A bit more about us

You probably won't have heard much about us, but we're one of the UK's biggest, home-grown success stories of the last 20 years. We're a FTSE 250 business and knocking on the door of £1 billion in annual revenue. But in two decades of phenomenal change and growth as a business, there are two things that have remained constant:

-We bundle together all our customers' household utilities and send them a single monthly bill
-We don't promote our services directly to customers - we have 40,000 partners around the country who recommend us.

And we know we’re onto something - we were the Which? ‘Utilities Brand of the Year’ again this year- but we’re only just getting started…

What we’re looking for

Our aim is to enable our people to deliver growth through a seamless employee experience and to do this we need a seamless navigation through our people systems and processes throughout the employee lifecycle. We are therefore looking for a detailed, problem solving and enthusiastic people data analyst, who can help us implement and improve our systems and integrations to enable processes that work.

What you’ll do

As the People Data Analyst you will work with the Head of People Systems and Analytics to ensure data is clean, valid and aligned in all our systems to enhance the processes and automation, provide data analysis, create reports for stakeholders and assist in administration of People systems. You will proactively analyse data and make recommendations where appropriate to develop to improve existing processes or data.
Linked to our People strategy, our focus is on self-service and simplicity through the use of our people systems, and you should look to help the Head of People Systems and Analytics to continuously improve how these are delivered and accessed by our employees and managers.
You will support all People transformation projects and other members of the People team with the data information. A key part of the role is to be part of the Payroll implementation project, responsible for the cleansing and migration of data for a new payroll system, ResourceLink, starting in January and the integration with the current People system, Bamboo.
What we’re offering

The opportunity to join an established but dynamic business that’s going through significant change and still has huge growth potential.

A very competitive basic salary, some great benefits and the potential to join our share option scheme.

Mediahub - Data Analyst,£32K - £43K (Glassdoor est.),"Hello.. We're looking for a Data Analyst!

Who are we?

We’re Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.

It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.

Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG’s Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

We’re an open and friendly bunch (well that’s what people tell us) and we welcome others readily into our team.

What will you do?

Everything from taking ownership of analytics output for our clients to collaborating with campaign teams to provide regular insights and recommendations that feed into optimisations to in-depth analysis/research.

You will be responsible for deploying the day-to-day analytical requirements of our key global accounts. This includes specification and creation of automated dashboards, campaign performance reviews, mining insights from multiple data sources as well as contributing to ongoing test and learn programmes.

You will be a pro within a media agency workflow, understand platforms that we can buy adverts through (Facebook, Google, etc), have a familiarity with the data that comes out of these platforms, and what all of this data means for our clients.

Requirements

About you?

This is an entry level opportunity, so we're not necessarily looking for any previous data analytics experience. You will need strong MS Excel skills for this one though and if you have experience with Python or R, that's a huge bonus.

If you are..
Curious about the world – You are excited about new technology, innovative marketing ideas and will bring the same to your media plans. You love insightful work.
A self-starter – You possess a can-do attitude and are eager to learn. You love taking responsibility and problem solving. You are ambitious and a go-getter.
A team player – You are resourceful & collaborative. You love learning from others and always ready to help others out. You’re proud of your craft, but you achieve the best results when you work with others.
Someone with a sense of fun – You can laugh at yourself and see the funny side of most situations. You work hard but know the importance of having fun.
...then this could be your new home. We can’t wait to meet you!

Benefits

Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

We are a global creative boutique of distinctive diverse agencies, rich in local culture with both intimacy and scale, present in more than 65 markets with over 90 agencies.

We're committed to employing a diverse and inclusive workforce, reflective of the customers and communities we serve – where all our colleagues can be themselves and succeed on merit.

In Consumer Servicing, we create a multi-channel experience that customers love, colleagues are proud of and make our service proposition a major competitive advantage for the Group.

This role is based within the Digital Analytics team, a Centre of Excellence for the Consumer Servicing Value Stream which provides insight and analytics to support decision making and measure performance. The Digital Data Analyst role provides a continuous flow of analytics and insight to the digital labs as part of an agile “on-demand” analytics service.

And what would you be doing...

You’ll have an excellent opportunity to support the digital labs in their mission to deliver an optimised digital experience.

Work with internal customers in the labs to understand their business challenges and reporting needs and discuss ideas on what data or insight will help them.

After that you’ll use your knowledge of our data and your data processing skills, plus your wider network of data SMEs when needed, to bring together the data required to provide the insights requested. You’ll also have a team around you to bounce ideas off and share your experiences with as you build your knowledge over time.

Once the data work is done you will use your analytical skills both to interpret the data, understand the insights in relation to the original business question, and present the findings in the most appropriate way in order to provide clear answers for the internal customer. It’s likely you’ll also be presenting your findings both to the business team who raised the request and to the wider team, sharing the insights you’ve found.

We work in an Agile squad, so you’ll work collaboratively in a cross functional team with no shortage of backlogged work! Daily stand ups, juggling priorities against a Kanban, maximising our collective productivity and a focus on continuous development will all be part of your work.

Here's what we're looking for...
We like people who come from diverse backgrounds that can bring new insights to the team. To be seriously considered we need to see the following background experience as a minimum:
Firstly, some proven experience working as a data analyst.
You’ll have a strong technical background with expertise in data manipulation, data storage technologies and data mining. Technical skills wise, you’ll be able to use SQL and have exposure to some Extract Transform Load (ETL) tools. You’ll also want to be comfortable investigating new data sources, ingesting and integrate data. Teradata is the main data warehouse platform.
Strong analytical skills and an inquisitive mind will be key in understanding the subtleties of some very complex datasets. Good business understanding, particularly digital customer servicing, as well as excellent communication skills to be able to share their findings with both technical and business partners to inform decisions.
Having previously worked in an Agile environment would be useful so you can collaborate as part of an agile team delivering against a backlog of work. We use tools like Jira and Confluence.
The cherry on the cake for us would be to find someone with exposure to any of the following, but please apply if you don’t: Any experience of data visualisation tools like Tableau or Power BI, or any experience having worked on digital customer journeys and the associated datasets.

We're focused on creating a values-led culture and are committed to building a workforce which reflects the diversity of the customers and communities we serve. Together we’re building a truly inclusive workplace where all of our colleagues have the opportunity to make a real difference.

Interested but have a question before you apply? Feel free to contact Tilke, Rob (Customer Insights Engagement) / Rob.Tilke@LloydsBanking.com
At Lloyds Banking Group, we're driven by a clear purpose; to help Britain prosper. Across the Group, our colleagues are focused on making a difference to customers, businesses and communities.

We make human data accessible, anywhere in the world, by connecting brands with real people on the ground to gather real-time in-the-moment insights at scale. We distil this data using machine learning technology to uncover not just what they do, but also why they do it, and what drives them - and predicts what they might do next.
Having raised Series B investment led by Lakestar, Streetbees’ partners with world leading brands across the FMCG, Media and Entertainment and Retail and Insurance sectors and our clients include Unilever, PepsiCo, Sony Pictures, Carlsberg, Santander, Ikea, Vodafone and L’Oreal.
We’re looking to add a Data Analyst to our Machine Learning team, working alongside our Data Scientists and Market Research strategists - to help them deliver insights for our clients about how they can improve their products, or new products that they should consider launching, using our machine learning technologies and tools.
We are looking for someone who is passionate about turning the raw material of data into advanced insights that will guide the future of brands that many millions of people use in their daily lives, and working with tools developed using the latest in machine learning to gain insights not possible before (when using traditional analytics). If you are excited by the idea of applying the latest in machine learning to disrupt an industry, defining what will become the new normal but doesn’t exist today, then this could be for you.
This is a hands-on role that needs strong rational and analytical skills to support data-driven decisions, and the right person will be very comfortable with SQL and Excel, capable with data querying and manipulation and visualisation, and given it is working with Data Scientists will have at some Python knowledge and skills (e.g. notebooks) for data exploration and manipulation. Any experience with statistical analysis of data (e.g. SPSS) and machine learning techniques is a definite plus (but not a requirement of the role).
It could suit someone with data analytics experience who wants to help pioneer new ways to do analytics using machine learning tools, or even someone who wants to explore whether they could bridge from a career in data analytics or data management into data science and machine learning themselves.
Responsibilities
Collaborating with internal data management, market research and data science colleagues on the analysis of data from projects carried out on behalf of Streetbees’ clients
Utilising traditional data exploration and analytical tools, along with machine learning analysis and tools to find the clusters, patterns, trends etc in the data that may be of interest in the submissions provided by the users of the Streetbees app
Performing machine learning techniques such as clustering, cluster drivers analysis, brand analysis, and natural language analysis on Streebees’ data. And performing traditional techniques such as segmentation, targeting, results analysis and reporting.
Running a portfolio of analytical projects with clients, managing the resources required for the project schedule. Identification, development and delivery of the most appropriate data analysis techniques for each project’s requirements, in collaboration with other teams
Acting as a key superuser of the machine learning tools and scripts and notebooks delivered by the data science team, assisting the data science team in developing them
Specifying the data management and manipulation needed by the internal data management team, assisting them with it where there are peaks in concurrent demand
Collaborating with the market research teams to define the narrative of the clusters, the insights and the other data findings
Attending client calls or meetings where needed, supporting the research and account teams in discussing the data insights gathered
Requirements
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
You have strong data, reasoning and analytical skills are essential
You will likely have experience of data management and processing, as well an analysis, in data-driven organisations
You will be organised and have good communication skills, comfortable balancing a number of projects at once, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders in several teams
You will be comfortable with data querying (relational databases and data-lakes using SQL), data interchange (CSV, JSON etc), data analysis (such as Excel and BI tools, maybe even Access), data management and processing using ETL platforms and/or scripting languages. Ideally the data scripting and manipulation scripting language you can use would be Python, with libraries like Pandas, and use of Jupyter notebooks.
Experience with data visualisation is beneficial but it’s not a requirement of the role. The more experience you have with statistical modelling techniques such as regressions, CHAID, and Bayesian techniques the better (but none are strict requirements of the role)
The more knowledge you have of and interest in learning about machine learning and deep learning the better (but it’s not a requirement of the role)
Start-up attitude – You’ll be comfortable in a rapidly changing environment, working with limited resources, and delivering high-quality work at the speed which is necessary for successful business growth. You’ll be a self-starter who doesn’t need much guidance, who can think fast on their feet and are ready to pivot when required

Senior Data Analyst / Scientist,£23K - £25K (Glassdoor est.),"Join one of Europe’s leading Fintech startups

iwoca is breaking down the barriers that stop Europe’s 20 million small businesses from accessing finance. We believe finance should make life easier, not harder, for small businesses. When small businesses go to traditional lenders they are forced to deal with long waits, absurdly rigid criteria, and impersonal bureaucracies. We believe small businesses deserve a financing service that strips out the hassle; that gets to know each customer’s needs; that generates opportunities instead of problems. iwoca is finance, custom-built to expand possibilities for small business.

We’re still near the start of our journey – our aim is to finance one million small businesses within a decade and we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.

We work hard to make iwoca a place where everyone feels welcome, where you can confidently be yourself. We understand that diversity isn't an optional add-on, it's the core ingredient of what makes us great.

We are looking for Data Scientists from strong analytical backgrounds that can take potentially ambiguous, real-world business problems and formulate statistical solutions, which can be implemented in a pragmatic way. We’re looking for people who understand the limitations and assumptions of such a modelling process and can generate actionable insights and build effective predictive models.

About us:
High calibre and diverse team of data scientists with a range of expertise.
All members of the team have strong analytical backgrounds in Physics, Mathematics, Engineering etc, some with PhDs in their respective field.
Broad and significant engagement in all steps of the problem solving process, including specification, solution proposal, implementation and delivery.
Our development cycle is tight and incorporates elements of Agile processes, which means features or projects go live in days or weeks rather than months or years.
We value personal development, constructive feedback, sharing knowledge and trying innovative solutions to problems.
What do we do?:
Application of statistical modelling and machine learning techniques.
Delivery of data driven solutions and predictions for a diverse range of business problems, including risk assessment and contact prioritisation.
Development of real-time data pipelining and delivery of ML predictions.
A/B testing and data analysis using statistical methods to generate insights and optimise existing and future business processes.
Multi-disciplinary projects with the wider tech team and business stakeholders.
Requirements
Strong analytical background, e.g PhD or degree in Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related field; or equivalent experience.
Good understanding of the techniques used in statistical data analysis, ability to generate well founded insights from potentially unstructured data.
Some practical application of predictive modelling and pragmatic implementation of machine learning techniques to effectively solve real-world problems is a bonus.
Someone that isn't satisfied with just applying out-of-the-box models, you want to know how they work, when they work and why they work.
Some practical object-oriented programming experience: Python, Java, C/C++ or similar.
Experience with some of the common Python data-science toolkits: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn is a bonus.
Experience with R, Matlab, and/or SQL would be beneficial.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously in a relatively unconstrained environment.
A healthy skepticism and desire to build innovative, but practical, solutions to business problems.
Love for coding and getting hands-on with the raw data to really understand the underlying processes and nuances of the problem.

Senior Data Analyst / Scientist,£23K - £25K (Glassdoor est.),"Join one of Europe’s leading Fintech startups

iwoca is breaking down the barriers that stop Europe’s 20 million small businesses from accessing finance. We believe finance should make life easier, not harder, for small businesses. When small businesses go to traditional lenders they are forced to deal with long waits, absurdly rigid criteria, and impersonal bureaucracies. We believe small businesses deserve a financing service that strips out the hassle; that gets to know each customer’s needs; that generates opportunities instead of problems. iwoca is finance, custom-built to expand possibilities for small business.

We’re still near the start of our journey – our aim is to finance one million small businesses within a decade and we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.

We work hard to make iwoca a place where everyone feels welcome, where you can confidently be yourself. We understand that diversity isn't an optional add-on, it's the core ingredient of what makes us great.

We are looking for Data Scientists from strong analytical backgrounds that can take potentially ambiguous, real-world business problems and formulate statistical solutions, which can be implemented in a pragmatic way. We’re looking for people who understand the limitations and assumptions of such a modelling process and can generate actionable insights and build effective predictive models.

About us:
High calibre and diverse team of data scientists with a range of expertise.
All members of the team have strong analytical backgrounds in Physics, Mathematics, Engineering etc, some with PhDs in their respective field.
Broad and significant engagement in all steps of the problem solving process, including specification, solution proposal, implementation and delivery.
Our development cycle is tight and incorporates elements of Agile processes, which means features or projects go live in days or weeks rather than months or years.
We value personal development, constructive feedback, sharing knowledge and trying innovative solutions to problems.
What do we do?:
Application of statistical modelling and machine learning techniques.
Delivery of data driven solutions and predictions for a diverse range of business problems, including risk assessment and contact prioritisation.
Development of real-time data pipelining and delivery of ML predictions.
A/B testing and data analysis using statistical methods to generate insights and optimise existing and future business processes.
Multi-disciplinary projects with the wider tech team and business stakeholders.
Requirements
Strong analytical background, e.g PhD or degree in Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related field; or equivalent experience.
Good understanding of the techniques used in statistical data analysis, ability to generate well founded insights from potentially unstructured data.
Some practical application of predictive modelling and pragmatic implementation of machine learning techniques to effectively solve real-world problems is a bonus.
Someone that isn't satisfied with just applying out-of-the-box models, you want to know how they work, when they work and why they work.
Some practical object-oriented programming experience: Python, Java, C/C++ or similar.
Experience with some of the common Python data-science toolkits: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn is a bonus.
Experience with R, Matlab, and/or SQL would be beneficial.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously in a relatively unconstrained environment.
A healthy skepticism and desire to build innovative, but practical, solutions to business problems.
Love for coding and getting hands-on with the raw data to really understand the underlying processes and nuances of the problem.
