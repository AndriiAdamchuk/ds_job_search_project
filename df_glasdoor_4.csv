What we do

The IPA works with government and industry to ensure projects are delivered efficiently and effectively, and to improve performance over time. We work on the overall project delivery system, which includes the projects, people and processes that together create the right environment for successful delivery. We measure how well the system is performing, so we can learn important lessons and continuously improve project performance over time.

Project & Structured Finance team

Our team comprises project finance and commercial specialists, policy advisors and analysts who work with government departments, other public bodies, and industry across a range of economic and social infrastructure sectors.

We support the delivery of infrastructure and major projects and advise on the availability and policy implications of private finance to the UK infrastructure market.

On behalf of HM Treasury, we manage the UK Guarantee Scheme, Private Finance 2 (PF2) equity investments and other UK infrastructure fund investments.

We oversee the operational Private Finance Initiative (PFI) portfolio and provide expert support and advice to departments and contracting authorities. This year we set up the PFI Contract Management Programme to manage the risks in operational PFI projects. The aim of the Programme is that all contracting authorities have the capabilities, knowledge and tools they need to manage their contracts effectively.

The Programme comprises four projects:

Managing the Exit from PFI Projects: assessing the readiness of authorities to manage the exit as contracts end, and developing and implementing systems learning.
Operational Contract Reviews: improving the performance and efficiency of operational projects.
Building Capability: building capability across the system through guidance, tools and training.
Advice & Support: providing expert advice to support the implementation of contract reviews and contract expiry health checks, and advice on policy and commercial issues.

iwoca is breaking down the barriers that stop Europe’s 20 million small businesses from accessing finance. We believe finance should make life easier, not harder, for small businesses. When small businesses go to traditional lenders they are forced to deal with long waits, absurdly rigid criteria, and impersonal bureaucracies. We believe small businesses deserve a financing service that strips out the hassle; that gets to know each customer’s needs; that generates opportunities instead of problems. iwoca is finance, custom-built to expand possibilities for small business.

We’re still near the start of our journey – our aim is to finance one million small businesses within a decade and we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.

We work hard to make iwoca a place where everyone feels welcome, where you can confidently be yourself. We understand that diversity isn't an optional add-on, it's the core ingredient of what makes us great.

We are looking for Data Scientists from strong analytical backgrounds that can take potentially ambiguous, real-world business problems and formulate statistical solutions, which can be implemented in a pragmatic way. We’re looking for people who understand the limitations and assumptions of such a modelling process and can generate actionable insights and build effective predictive models.

We value personal development, constructive feedback, sharing knowledge and trying innovative solutions to problems.
What do we do?:
Application of statistical modelling and machine learning techniques.
Delivery of data driven solutions and predictions for a diverse range of business problems, including risk assessment and contact prioritisation.
Development of real-time data pipelining and delivery of ML predictions.
A/B testing and data analysis using statistical methods to generate insights and optimise existing and future business processes.
Multi-disciplinary projects with the wider tech team and business stakeholders.
Requirements
Strong analytical background, e.g PhD or degree in Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related field; or equivalent experience.
Good understanding of the techniques used in statistical data analysis, ability to generate well founded insights from potentially unstructured data.
Some practical application of predictive modelling and pragmatic implementation of machine learning techniques to effectively solve real-world problems is a bonus.
Someone that isn't satisfied with just applying out-of-the-box models, you want to know how they work, when they work and why they work.
Some practical object-oriented programming experience: Python, Java, C/C++ or similar.
Experience with some of the common Python data-science toolkits: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn is a bonus.
Experience with R, Matlab, and/or SQL would be beneficial.

iwoca is breaking down the barriers that stop Europe’s 20 million small businesses from accessing finance. We believe finance should make life easier, not harder, for small businesses. When small businesses go to traditional lenders they are forced to deal with long waits, absurdly rigid criteria, and impersonal bureaucracies. We believe small businesses deserve a financing service that strips out the hassle; that gets to know each customer’s needs; that generates opportunities instead of problems. iwoca is finance, custom-built to expand possibilities for small business.

We’re still near the start of our journey – our aim is to finance one million small businesses within a decade and we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.

We work hard to make iwoca a place where everyone feels welcome, where you can confidently be yourself. We understand that diversity isn't an optional add-on, it's the core ingredient of what makes us great.

We are looking for Data Scientists from strong analytical backgrounds that can take potentially ambiguous, real-world business problems and formulate statistical solutions, which can be implemented in a pragmatic way.

We value personal development, constructive feedback, sharing knowledge and trying innovative solutions to problems.
What do we do?:
Application of statistical modelling and machine learning techniques.
Delivery of data driven solutions and predictions for a diverse range of business problems, including risk assessment and contact prioritisation.

Good understanding of the techniques used in statistical data analysis, ability to generate well founded insights from potentially unstructured data.
Some practical application of predictive modelling and pragmatic implementation of machine learning techniques to effectively solve real-world problems is a bonus.
Someone that isn't satisfied with just applying out-of-the-box models, you want to know how they work, when they work and why they work.
Some practical object-oriented programming experience: Python, Java, C/C++ or similar.
Experience with some of the common Python data-science toolkits: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn is a bonus.
Experience with R, Matlab, and/or SQL would be beneficial.
