The dashboard is interactive so check it out here and have a look at what the numbers mean, https://bit.ly/2MhjAZT

For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

About us

GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you're speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behavior and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies, consistently renewing over 98% of our client base and doubling in size and revenue year-on-year. Our survey now represents more than 2 billion connected consumers, creating over 40,000 data points for clients including Twitter, Google, Spotify, WPP and Omnicom Group.

We're not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we're on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we're on the lookout for talented people to join us.

About diversity and inclusion

Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business. We're so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it's really important to us that it stays that way. That means whatever your race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.",3.0,"GWI

You will ideally be maths / data savvy because the role centres on data capture and transformation prior to input into our quantification models.

This position will likely suit a graduate or someone on a year off before university, however all applicants are encouraged to apply.

Ideally the role is to be in the London offices of this financial planning business, where they can provide double screens, fast internet, desk space etc and one or more of the team can be in the office one or more days each week to support. However, at the moment this looks unlikely with the current guidelines in place so if the only option is to work from home, then the person would need to have a space / desk with enough room for a double screen set-up (which they will supply).

The role will entail:
The source of information to be analysed in bank statements supplied by corporate clients. These are electronic (rather than on paper), mostly convertible into Excel although many are in PDF form.
This process involves transforming or re-inputting certain data fields from the statements into an Excel spreadsheet that we have designed. The design is linked to algorithms (models) which are programmed in R. No knowledge of R is required. It can take up to a day to process each company. There are up to 100 companies involved.
The key requirement is for accuracy. There will be spot checks by a supervising data analyst, and instructions on how to avoid typical mistakes (we’ve all done this and made them). You will be involved in daily team meetings where we all share what’s been completed and what’s next on our to-do list. This shares achievements and allows you to re-prioritise those to-do lists (new things come along that are more ‘urgent’ than ‘important’) when needed.
There is inevitably a high degree of repetition although this does have advantages – speed and efficiency go up, as does satisfaction (data transformation, as this is known, is a life skill for anyone who wants to work with numbers, in whatever field) and the sense of involvement within a team that knows what this takes and is grateful for your hard work and need it to be right so that the output can be fed into our algorithms (models).

Data Analyst
My client, an industry leading Professional Services company, is looking for a Data Analyst with strong Tableau and SQL skills to join their growing team.
You will be responsible for supporting the Insight Manager and Data Engineers with delivery of actionable insight on the back of Data Analysis you conduct. You would be involved in the optimisation, development & implementation of databases, data analytics, but will not get involved in the ETL / Data Engineering side - that is for another team. Your role will be to make sense of that data and tell a story to a Data Led organisation to help them improve how they operate across multiple areas of the organisation.
This is a role that requires great communication skills to engage with the business and stakeholders, in addition to strong Technical skills.
Because of the various databases, you would need to have strong SQL skills to interrogate the database
This will be put to the test during the interview process.
Whilst they also use Alteryx, the greater flexibility or SQL will be utilised more in future, so Alteryx is only a nice to have.
The first 6 months will be spent sorting out their current Tableau dashboards in operation (there are many that overlap, and are difficult to maintain, so must be streamlined to increase impact).
The key thing with this role is that you need Dashboarding skills, but also the ability to tell a story using data, and demonstrate actioned insight you have offered previous places of work.
It is critical that you have demonstrable examples of your Tableau dashboards to share in interview - either a portfolio or screenshots, as the design and presentation of data is very important in this position.
Whilst you would obviously be working from home in the short term, longer term they would like you to still interact personally with the stakeholders in the business, and so would need to be in around 3 days a week in the office - based in Central London, so remote workers are not encouraged to apply.
If you are keen to work in a stable and secure organisation that has some great data to work with then please get in touch ASAP with your CV and portfolio (for your dashboards).

Hello, we're Utility Warehouse

We help people get on with their lives and spend their time how they want to. And we’re bringing together a nation of self-starters to build a different type of utility company. One where partners can run their own business and reach the goals that matter to them.
For customers, we offer permanent peace of mind. One bill, great value and no need to ever switch again. And for our people, we provide clear opportunities to help them achieve both their professional and their personal ambitions.


A bit more about us

You probably won't have heard much about us, but we're one of the UK's biggest, home-grown success stories of the last 20 years. We're a FTSE 250 business and knocking on the door of £1 billion in annual revenue. But in two decades of phenomenal change and growth as a business, there are two things that have remained constant:

-We bundle together all our customers' household utilities and send them a single monthly bill
-We don't promote our services directly to customers - we have 40,000 partners around the country who recommend us.

And we know we’re onto something - we were the Which? ‘Utilities Brand of the Year’ again this year- but we’re only just getting started…

Who are we?

We’re Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.

It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.

Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG’s Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

We’re an open and friendly bunch (well that’s what people tell us) and we welcome others readily into our team.

What will you do?

Everything from taking ownership of analytics output for our clients to collaborating with campaign teams to provide regular insights and recommendations that feed into optimisations to in-depth analysis/research.

You will be responsible for deploying the day-to-day analytical requirements of our key global accounts. This includes specification and creation of automated dashboards, campaign performance reviews, mining insights from multiple data sources as well as contributing to ongoing test and learn programmes.

You will be a pro within a media agency workflow, understand platforms that we can buy adverts through (Facebook, Google, etc), have a familiarity with the data that comes out of these platforms, and what all of this data means for our clients.

Requirements

About you?

This is an entry level opportunity, so we're not necessarily looking for any previous data analytics experience. You will need strong MS Excel skills for this one though and if you have experience with Python or R, that's a huge bonus.

If you are..
Curious about the world – You are excited about new technology, innovative marketing ideas and will bring the same to your media plans. You love insightful work.
A self-starter – You possess a can-do attitude and are eager to learn. You love taking responsibility and problem solving. You are ambitious and a go-getter.
A team player – You are resourceful & collaborative. You love learning from others and always ready to help others out. You’re proud of your craft, but you achieve the best results when you work with others.
Someone with a sense of fun – You can laugh at yourself and see the funny side of most situations. You work hard but know the importance of having fun.
...then this could be your new home. We can’t wait to meet you!

Benefits

Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
