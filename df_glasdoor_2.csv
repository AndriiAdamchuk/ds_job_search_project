Job Description
Who are Consumer Servicing and the Digital Analytics Team in Lloyds Banking Group?

Lloyds Banking Group is the UK's largest digital bank with 17 million active online customers across our four brands. Within Consumer Servicing, our purpose is to run and grow the digital channel, optimising to deliver a leading customer experience and creating simple, convenient and personalised onboarding and servicing journeys to delight customers across the Retail Bank channels.

We're committed to employing a diverse and inclusive workforce, reflective of the customers and communities we serve – where all our colleagues can be themselves and succeed on merit.

In Consumer Servicing, we create a multi-channel experience that customers love, colleagues are proud of and make our service proposition a major competitive advantage for the Group.

This role is based within the Digital Analytics team, a Centre of Excellence for the Consumer Servicing Value Stream which provides insight and analytics to support decision making and measure performance. The Digital Data Analyst role provides a continuous flow of analytics and insight to the digital labs as part of an agile “on-demand” analytics service.

And what would you be doing...

You’ll have an excellent opportunity to support the digital labs in their mission to deliver an optimised digital experience.

Work with internal customers in the labs to understand their business challenges and reporting needs and discuss ideas on what data or insight will help them.

After that you’ll use your knowledge of our data and your data processing skills, plus your wider network of data SMEs when needed, to bring together the data required to provide the insights requested. You’ll also have a team around you to bounce ideas off and share your experiences with as you build your knowledge over time.

Once the data work is done you will use your analytical skills both to interpret the data, understand the insights in relation to the original business question, and present the findings in the most appropriate way in order to provide clear answers for the internal customer. It’s likely you’ll also be presenting your findings both to the business team who raised the request and to the wider team, sharing the insights you’ve found.

We work in an Agile squad, so you’ll work collaboratively in a cross functional team with no shortage of backlogged work! Daily stand ups, juggling priorities against a Kanban, maximising our collective productivity and a focus on continuous development will all be part of your work.

Here's what we're looking for...
We like people who come from diverse backgrounds that can bring new insights to the team. To be seriously considered we need to see the following background experience as a minimum:
Firstly, some proven experience working as a data analyst.
You’ll have a strong technical background with expertise in data manipulation, data storage technologies and data mining. Technical skills wise, you’ll be able to use SQL and have exposure to some Extract Transform Load (ETL) tools. You’ll also want to be comfortable investigating new data sources, ingesting and integrate data. Teradata is the main data warehouse platform.
Strong analytical skills and an inquisitive mind will be key in understanding the subtleties of some very complex datasets. Good business understanding, particularly digital customer servicing, as well as excellent communication skills to be able to share their findings with both technical and business partners to inform decisions.
Having previously worked in an Agile environment would be useful so you can collaborate as part of an agile team delivering against a backlog of work. We use tools like Jira and Confluence.
The cherry on the cake for us would be to find someone with exposure to any of the following, but please apply if you don’t: Any experience of data visualisation tools like Tableau or Power BI, or any experience having worked on digital customer journeys and the associated datasets.

We're focused on creating a values-led culture and are committed to building a workforce which reflects the diversity of the customers and communities we serve. Together we’re building a truly inclusive workplace where all of our colleagues have the opportunity to make a real difference.

Interested but have a question before you apply? Feel free to contact Tilke, Rob (Customer Insights Engagement) / Rob.Tilke@LloydsBanking.com
At Lloyds Banking Group, we're driven by a clear purpose; to help Britain prosper. Across the Group, our colleagues are focused on making a difference to customers, businesses and communities.

We distil this data using machine learning technology to uncover not just what they do, but also why they do it, and what drives them - and predicts what they might do next.
Having raised Series B investment led by Lakestar, Streetbees’ partners with world leading brands across the FMCG, Media and Entertainment and Retail and Insurance sectors and our clients include Unilever, PepsiCo, Sony Pictures, Carlsberg, Santander, Ikea, Vodafone and L’Oreal.

We are looking for someone who is passionate about turning the raw material of data into advanced insights that will guide the future of brands that many millions of people use in their daily lives, and working with tools developed using the latest in machine learning to gain insights not possible before (when using traditional analytics). If you are excited by the idea of applying the latest in machine learning to disrupt an industry, defining what will become the new normal but doesn’t exist today, then this could be for you.
This is a hands-on role that needs strong rational and analytical skills to support data-driven decisions, and the right person will be very comfortable with SQL and Excel, capable with data querying and manipulation and visualisation, and given it is working with Data Scientists will have at some Python knowledge and skills (e.g. notebooks) for data exploration and manipulation. Any experience with statistical analysis of data (e.g. SPSS) and machine learning techniques is a definite plus (but not a requirement of the role).
It could suit someone with data analytics experience who wants to help pioneer new ways to do analytics using machine learning tools, or even someone who wants to explore whether they could bridge from a career in data analytics or data management into data science and machine learning themselves.
Responsibilities
Collaborating with internal data management, market research and data science colleagues on the analysis of data from projects carried out on behalf of Streetbees’ clients
Utilising traditional data exploration and analytical tools, along with machine learning analysis and tools to find the clusters, patterns, trends etc in the data that may be of interest in the submissions provided by the users of the Streetbees app

Acting as a key superuser of the machine learning tools and scripts and notebooks delivered by the data science team, assisting the data science team in developing them
Specifying the data management and manipulation needed by the internal data management team, assisting them with it where there are peaks in concurrent demand
Collaborating with the market research teams to define the narrative of the clusters, the insights and the other data findings
Attending client calls or meetings where needed, supporting the research and account teams in discussing the data insights gathered

You will likely have experience of data management and processing, as well an analysis, in data-driven organisations
You will be organised and have good communication skills, comfortable balancing a number of projects at once, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders in several teams
You will be comfortable with data querying (relational databases and data-lakes using SQL), data interchange (CSV, JSON etc), data analysis (such as Excel and BI tools, maybe even Access), data management and processing using ETL platforms and/or scripting languages. Ideally the data scripting and manipulation scripting language you can use would be Python, with libraries like Pandas, and use of Jupyter notebooks.
Experience with data visualisation is beneficial but it’s not a requirement of the role. The more experience you have with statistical modelling techniques such as regressions, CHAID, and Bayesian techniques the better (but none are strict requirements of the role)
The more knowledge you have of and interest in learning about machine learning and deep learning the better (but it’s not a requirement of the role)
Start-up attitude – You’ll be comfortable in a rapidly changing environment, working with limited resources, and delivering high-quality work at the speed which is necessary for successful business growth. You’ll be a self-starter who doesn’t need much guidance, who can think fast on their feet and are ready to pivot when required
